## Introduction
This project aims to create a planning system for the cookie production in Krusty Kookies Sweden AB. All relevant information regarding the production, orders, and deliveries is maintained in a local database. The software system is intended to be split into three parts, and only the one handling production is implemented here.

## Requirements
# Implemented
* Complete database
* Can add a pallet to database, of specified type and time of production.
* Can block all pallets containing a certain product, within specified time interval.
* Can check how many pallets that have been produced within a specified time interval.
* Can check how many pallets that have been produced of a specific type.
* Can check how many pallets that have been blocked.
* Can monitor the correct location of a pallet.
* Can remove a pallet from the freezer, if there is a valid order for it.
* Deducts material from storage when a pallet of cookies is produced.

# Unimplemented
* Can read/add/update/remove recipes.
* Can add/read/remove orders.
* Can add/read/remove material to storage.
* Can list all pallets that have been delivered to a specific customer, including time of delivery.
* Can create a loading order.
* Can create a loading bill.

## System Outline
sqlite3 is used to create the initial database, which is then manipulated through Java and JDBC. 

A custom database class implements a set amount of methods. The method arguments are used to query the database through prepared statements, which sanitizes the input and guarantees prevention of SQL-injections.
